We are doing another "Heinz's Happy Hour" webinar on Thursday.  This time we are looking at the Observer pattern from many different angles.  Would love for you to join us!

 

All GoF patterns appear somewhere in the JDK, but these five stand out: Proxy, Composite, Observer, Iterator, Visitor.  They are called by that name exactly.  Oldest of these is the Observer.  It shows.  Using Vector to effectively do a CopyOnWriteArraySet?  Yuck!  

In the 4th Heinz's Happy Hour on the 9th March 2017 at 17:00 UTC, we will look at java.util.Observer from many angles:

   1. How can we hack generics into this class using mutually recursive bounds (compliments of Maurice Nafalin's book)
   2. How does the implementation differ from the GoF typical structure?
   3. How could we improve the inner workings of Observable, and why is it so complicated?
   4. Livelocks in observable updates
   5. An exclusive look at Heinz's CRM that uses Infusionsoft tags and the Observer pattern extensively to manage newsletter subscribers, JCreteÂ® and customer enquiries.

We'd love for you to join us if you have time.
